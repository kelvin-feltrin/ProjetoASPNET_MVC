## About the project
The "Sales System" project was developed to put into practice the development of an application that uses a more robust architecture, used in corporate systems.

The application is a sales system that manages customers and products, registering, editing, viewing and deleting them.

The DDD pattern was used with ASP.NET MVC 5.2, Entity Framework, AutoMapper and IoC with Ninjec.

Project based on Eduardo Pires' tutorial: [Tutorial ASP.NET MVC 5 + DDD + EF + AutoMapper + IoC + Dicas e Truques](https://www.eduardopires.net.br/2014/10/tutorial-asp-net-mvc-5-ddd-ef-automapper-ioc-dicas-e-truques/)
